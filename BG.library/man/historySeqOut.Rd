\arguments{
\item{data}{data.frame to be plotted}

\item{plotName}{character string name of saved plot to be executed.   If \code{plotName = NA} plot to execute is
not a saved plot.}

plot set to \code{NA}}

\item{plotType}{character string indicating type of plot to execute (i.e. 'plotLine_ly',
'summaryPlot_ly' or 'heatmMap_ly')}

\item{seqType}{character string indicating the type of historical sequence to output
('change' indicating plots at dates where pump settings where changed or 'days' for plots
every \code{period} number of days)}

\item{seqLength}{number of plots to output}

\item{period}{number of days per plot if \code{seqType = 'days'}}

\item{reportTitle}{character string title for html document}

\item{outPath}{character string directory in which to output html document, if \code{outPath<-NA}
temporary html document will be stored in ./BG.library/reports/historySeqOut.html}

temporary html document will be stored in ./BG.library/reports/historySeqOut.html}

\item{libraryPath}{character string path to BG.library code}

\item{path}{character path to directory in which import file is located.}

\item{fileName}{charcter string csv file name}
