# BG.library
NO MEDICAL DECISIONS SHOULD BE MADE ON THE BASIS OF THESE RESULTS!

This is a library of functions to analyze my personal Blood Glucose data with html reports generated in Rmarkdown and a shiny ploting app using the interactive plotting package 'plotly'.  These functions are in development stages and have not been fully tested, verified, or formally reviewed by an outside source. Examples of function executions can be found in the csvAnalysis.R file.

I strongly advise against making medical decisions based on analysis using these functions to analyze your BG data.

Results are not guaranteed.
