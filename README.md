# BG.library
This is a library of functions to analyze my personal Blood Glucose data with html reports generated in Rmarkdown and a shiny ploting app using the interactive plotting package 'plotly'.  These functions are in development stages and have not been fully tested, verified, or formally reviewed by an outside source. 

I strongly advise against using these functions to analyze your BG data.

Results are not guaranteed.
